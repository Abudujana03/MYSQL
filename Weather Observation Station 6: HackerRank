Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
The STATION table is described as follows:
Field                     |  type
ID                        | NUMBER
CITY                      | VARCAHR2(21)
STATE                     | VARCAHR2(2)
LAT_N                     | NUMBER
LONG_W                    | NUMBER
where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

ANSWER:
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE UPPER(SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1)) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U');
